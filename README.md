# rust-llvm12-regression

This is a minimized test case for a rust-program that worked prior to upgrade to LLVM 12.

The program is the result of minimizing a much larger program. The program in its present state doesn't really make sense. But it probably shouldn't crash with a segfault.

This repo is a test case for issue https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87213 .
